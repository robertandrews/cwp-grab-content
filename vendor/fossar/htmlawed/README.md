This is a fork of [kesar/HTMLawed](https://github.com/kesar/HTMLawed) mainly to be able to handle changes faster than in upstream. And we contribute back to the upstream from time to time.

People from [selfoss](https://selfoss.aditu.de/) & [wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/en) maintain it and improve it.

> HTMLawed is a single-file, 45 kb PHP script that makes input text more secure, HTML standards-compliant, and
suitable in general from the viewpoint of a web-page administrator, for use in the body of HTML, XHTML
or XML documents. A simple HTMLTidy alternative, the htmLawed filter, processor, purifier, sanitizer,
beautifier, etc., is highly customizable.
